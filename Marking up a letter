  <h1>Re: Eileen Dover University Application</h1>
  <p>
    Dear Eileen,<br><br>
    Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one in the following sections.
  </p>

  <h2>Starting Dates</h2>
  <p>
    We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time. However, it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester. The start dates for each one are as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
    <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
    <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Please let me know if this is okay, and if so, which start date you would prefer. You can find more information about 
    <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">important university dates</a> on our website.
  </p>

  <h2>Subjects of Study</h2>
  <p>
    At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted, we were most intrigued by the following (in order of priority):
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3).</li>
    <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10³ increasing to 3 × 10⁴).</li>
    <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Please provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know. Thanks.
  </p>

  <h2>Exotic Dance Moves</h2>
  <p>
    Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Polynesian Chicken Dance:</strong> <em>A little-known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300 BC. A whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful."</em>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Icelandic Brownian Shuffle:</strong> <em>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together on the floor and shuffling their bodies in tiny, rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</em>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Arctic Robot Dance:</strong> <em>An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed they had discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic" movements, practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later, it was found they moved this way because they were very cold.</em>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
